# Airbnb Clone Project  

## üöÄ Objective  
Build a scalable Airbnb-like platform for property listings, bookings, and payments.  

## üèÜ Goals  
- User authentication & profile management  
- Property listing & booking system  
- Secure payment integration  
- Scalable backend with APIs  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack  
- **Backend**: Django  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **API**: GraphQL & REST  
- **Deployment**: Docker, CI/CD  


## üë• Team Roles  

- **Backend Developer**:  
  Responsible for building the server-side logic of the application. This includes developing APIs, implementing business logic, and integrating third-party services to ensure smooth communication between the client and the server.

- **Database Administrator (DBA)**:  
  Designs and maintains the project‚Äôs databases. Ensures data integrity, implements indexing for performance optimization, and manages backups, migrations, and database security.

- **DevOps Engineer**:  
  Handles deployment, automation, and infrastructure management. Sets up and monitors CI/CD pipelines, manages cloud resources, and ensures scalability, reliability, and smooth delivery of updates.

- **QA Engineer**:  
  Ensures the quality of the software through testing. This includes writing and running test cases, identifying bugs, verifying security, and validating that all features meet requirements before release.


## Technology Stack
- **Django**: Python web framework to build REST APIs.
- **Django REST Framework**: API tools for CRUD operations.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured storage.
- **GraphQL**: Flexible query language for efficient data retrieval.
- **Celery + Redis**: Asynchronous tasks & caching.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployments.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automating CI/CD pipeline.


## Database Design
### Entities:
- **Users**
  - id, name, email, password, role
- **Properties**
  - id, title, description, price, host_id
- **Bookings**
  - id, user_id, property_id, check_in, check_out, status
- **Payments**
  - id, booking_id, amount, status, timestamp
- **Reviews**
  - id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment

### Relationships:
- A **user** can list many **properties**.
- A **booking** belongs to one **property** and one **user**.
- A **payment** belongs to a **booking**.
- A **review** is written by a **user** for a **property**.

## ## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management  
This feature handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. It ensures that both guests and hosts have secure access to the platform, with proper account setup and login functionality.  

### 2. Property Management  
Hosts can list properties, update details, upload images, and manage availability. This feature ensures that potential guests have accurate and up-to-date information when searching for accommodations.  

### 3. Booking System  
Guests can search for available properties, select dates, and make reservations. The system manages availability calendars and prevents double-bookings, creating a smooth experience for both hosts and guests.  

### 4. Payment Processing  
Secure payment gateways are integrated to allow guests to pay for bookings and hosts to receive payouts. This ensures trust and financial security within the platform.  

### 5. Search & Filtering  
Guests can search for properties based on location, price, amenities, and availability. This feature improves usability by helping users quickly find the most relevant listings.  

### 6. Reviews & Ratings  
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay. This builds trust within the community and helps future guests make informed decisions.  

### 7. Admin Dashboard  
An admin panel provides oversight of users, properties, and transactions. This feature ensures smooth operation, compliance, and fraud detection across the platform.  


## API Security  

Securing the backend APIs is critical to ensure the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of the Airbnb Clone platform. The following security measures will be implemented:  

### 1. Authentication  
All users must verify their identity through secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT tokens, OAuth).  
**Why it matters:** This ensures only registered and verified users can access protected features such as booking and property management.  

### 2. Authorization  
Role-based access control will be enforced to differentiate between hosts, guests, and admins.  
**Why it matters:** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing or modifying sensitive data (e.g., only hosts can manage their listings, only admins can manage the entire system).  

### 3. Data Encryption  
Sensitive information (like passwords and payment details) will be encrypted both in transit (HTTPS/SSL) and at rest.  
**Why it matters:** Protects user data from being intercepted or leaked during communication or storage.  

### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling  
API requests will be rate-limited to prevent abuse such as brute force attacks or denial-of-service attempts.  
**Why it matters:** Ensures system stability and protects against malicious overloads.  

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization  
All inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).  
**Why it matters:** Protects both the database and users from data corruption or exploitation.  

By implementing these security measures, the Airbnb Clone project will safeguard user data, secure payment transactions, and maintain a trustworthy experience for all users.  


## CI/CD Pipeline

A **CI/CD pipeline** (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) is an automated process that helps developers integrate code changes frequently, test them efficiently, and deploy applications reliably. It ensures that the Airbnb Clone project remains stable, scalable, and ready for production as new features are added.

CI/CD is important for this project because it:
- Reduces the risk of bugs by running automated tests before deployment.  
- Speeds up development cycles with continuous integration of new features.  
- Ensures smooth, repeatable deployments with minimal downtime.  

**Tools we can use for the pipeline include:**
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating builds, tests, and deployments.  
- **Docker**: To containerize the application and ensure consistency across environments.  
- **Jenkins or Travis CI**: Alternative CI/CD tools for advanced workflows.  
- **Kubernetes** (optional): For orchestrating deployments in production environments.
